# Active-Learning-API

This API was developed to reduce analyze time of VCEs by doctors. To achieve that I build machine learning classifiers, but to do it I need to use labeled frames to train neuronal networks.
Like annotations tasks is expensive was used Active Learning technics to reduce anotations costs.

The final result is a binary classifier builded using Active Learning technics to classify VCEs and automatize a human task
