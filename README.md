# Active-Learning-API

This API was developed to reduce analyze the time of VCEs by doctors. To achieve that I build machine learning classifiers, but to do it I need to use labelled frames to train neuronal networks. Like annotations tasks are expensive was used Active Learning technics to reduce annotations costs.

The final result is a binary classifier built using Active Learning technics to classify VCEs and automatize a human task
